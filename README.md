# Dan's Alexa Skills

![Echo](https://github.com/danrice92/dansalexaskills/blob/master/amazon_echo.jpg)

This repo is for some Skills I built for the Amazon Alexa platform, most popularly used by the Amazon Echo. I used [Amazon's Alexa Skills Kit Samples](https://github.com/amzn/alexa-skills-kit-js) as a model for my Skills.

The first is Dan's Finance Game, a trivia game skill about personal finance. It is currently live on the Alexa platform and has over thirty questions to ask you!

The second is Dan's US History Facts, a skill that lets you ask Alexa for a US history fact. Alexa responds with one of the many facts completely at random. It has over seventy history facts and is live on Alexa.

The third is Debt Discouragement, which required much more customization to complete. It allows the user to ask Alexa about a variety of different types of debt, from payday loans to home mortgages! It is submitted and under review at Amazon.
