# Dan's Alexa Skills

![Echo](https://github.com/danrice92/dansalexaskills/blob/master/amazon_echo.jpg)

This repo is for some Skills I built for the Amazon Alexa platform, most popularly used by the Amazon Echo.

The first is Dan's Finance Game, a trivia game skill made for my software development course at [Bloc](http://bloc.io). I used Amazon's [Alexa Skills Kit Samples](https://github.com/amzn/alexa-skills-kit-js) repo as a model for the game. The game can be found under samples, DansFinanceGame, src, index.js, and is currently live on the Alexa platform! It has over thirty personal finance trivia questions, with more to come down the road!

The second is Dan's US History Facts, a skill that lets you ask Alexa for a US history fact. Alexa responds with one of the many facts completely at random. It can be found under samples, DansHistoryFacts, src, index.js. It has over seventy history facts in it and is currently submitted and under review at Amazon.

The third is Debt Discouragement, which is the first Alexa skill I built without (heavy) reliance on a template. It allows the user to ask Alexa what else they could do with their money rather than go into debt, for both practical and hilarious responses!
