# Dan's Alexa Skills

![Echo](alexa-skills-kit-js/amazon_echo.jpg)

This repo is for some Skills I built for the Amazon Alexa platform, most popularly used by the Amazon Echo.

The first is Dan's Finance Game, a trivia game skill made for my software development course at [Bloc](http://bloc.io). I used Amazon's [Alexa Skills Kit Samples](https://github.com/amzn/alexa-skills-kit-js) repo as a model for the game. The game can be found under samples, DansFinanceGame, src, index.js. It currently has over thirty personal finance trivia questions, with more to come down the road!

The second is Dan's US History Facts, a skill that lets you ask Alexa for a US history fact. Alexa responds with one of the many facts completely at random. It can be found under samples, DansHistoryFacts, src, index.js. It has over seventy history facts in it, with more yet to come!
