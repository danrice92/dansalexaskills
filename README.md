# Dan's Finance Game

This repo is for Dan's Finance Game, a trivia game skill for Amazon Alexa made for my software development course at [Bloc](http://bloc.io). I used Amazon's [Alexa Skills Kit Samples](https://github.com/amzn/alexa-skills-kit-js) repo as a model for the game. The game I used can be found under samples, DansFinanceGame, src, index.js. It currently has over thirty personal finance trivia questions, with more to come down the road!
